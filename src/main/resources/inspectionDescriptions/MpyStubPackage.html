<p>Detects when no MicroPython stub package is selected while stubs are enabled.</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps identify projects where stub support is enabled but no valid stub package has been configured.
    Without a selected stub package, essential IDE features such as autocompletion, type checking, and documentation
    lookup will not function for MicroPython-specific APIs.
</p>

<p>
    To fix this, go to <a href="settings://dev.micropythontools.settings.MpyConfigurable">MicroPython Tools Settings</a>
    and select or install a stub package that matches your board and MicroPython version.

<p>This issue is commonly encountered after project import or first-time plugin setup.</p>
